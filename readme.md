## TCM - Project Management
TCM is a Web-Based tool intended to streamline the Project Management Process. Unlike other Project Management software, TCM strives to take a user-centric approach wherever possible. 
This means thinking like a project manager wherever possible. Features of TCM will include interoperability with Excel (we know you are still using excel for scheduling tracking data, its ok),
Scheduling, Employee and Resource Management, and tons more. We want to hear from you, please reach out with suggestions, feature requests, and stories of how your current project management software could be better.
